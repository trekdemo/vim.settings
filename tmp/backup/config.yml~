  # Where do you store your code?
  # This is not needed if all your projects are using Git for versioning control
  # as the project's name and path would be determined from the folder name that
  # contains the .git folder, if that's the case, wherever you store your code,
  # the project name and path can be retrived very easily.
  code_path: ~/Sites

  # How do you nest your code folder?
  # Again this setting is only effective if not all your projects are using Git
  # For example consider this layout of the code folder
  #
  # ~/Code/
  #    Clients/
  #        AcmeCorp/
  #            website/
  #            intranet
  #        BetaCorp/
  #           skunkworks/
  #    OpenSource/
  #        project_one/
  #        timetap/
  #
  # A nested_project_layers setting of 2 would mean we track "AcmeCorp", "BetaCorp", and everything
  # under OpenSource, as their own projects

  # Pause time, default: 30 minutes
  # The pause time is the time to be considered as a pause time, if you save

  # as a work time and thus won't be counted in the elapsed time of the project
